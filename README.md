# CoSfM
CoSfM is An Agisoft Metashape plugin based on its Python API, which can simultaneously co-register multi-temporal images and implement photogrammetry, so that the generated multi-temporal three-dimensional spatial data are directly located in the same reference coordinate system, enabling the high-precision spatio-temporal analyses, such as deformation monitoring and change detection.
